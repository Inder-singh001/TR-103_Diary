### Creating the Same Page Using Bootstrap
On Day 4, I shifted gears and recreated the login page using the Bootstrap framework. This experience highlighted the advantages of using a CSS framework to streamline development. I began by setting up the Bootstrap environment and exploring its grid system, which would allow for a responsive layout. Learning to use Bootstrap was crucial, as it is widely adopted in the industry for its efficiency.

I rebuilt the login form, utilizing Bootstrap's predefined classes for form elements, buttons, and spacing. This significantly sped up the development process. I also discovered components like alerts and modals, which could enhance user interactions. I learned how Bootstrap's responsive utilities helped the login form adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on various devices. By the end of the day, I had not only recreated the login page but also understood how frameworks like Bootstrap can enhance efficiency and maintainability in web development. This realization motivated me to explore more of Bootstrap's features in the upcoming projects.
