### Completing the Responsive Design
On Day 10, I continued my efforts to complete the responsive design for the landing page. I conducted extensive testing across multiple devices and browsers to ensure a consistent user experience. This hands-on approach revealed areas that required further refinement, and I learned how to use developer tools for responsive testing.

I made adjustments to the CSS to enhance the mobile experience, ensuring that buttons were easily tappable and that text remained legible on smaller screens. This process emphasized the importance of user testing in web development, as it allowed me to see the design from a user's perspective. By the end of the day, I had a fully responsive landing page that provided an excellent user experience, and I felt proud of the work I had accomplished.
