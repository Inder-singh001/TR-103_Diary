### Creating a Static HTML Login Page Using Vanilla CSS
On Day 2, I set out to create a static login page using only HTML and vanilla CSS. This exercise was a practical application of the concepts I learned on the first day. I began by sketching a layout for the login form, which included fields for the username and password, a submit button, and a "Forgot Password?" link. I understood that user authentication is a critical component of many web applications, making this task even more relevant.

I wrote the HTML structure first, ensuring that I used semantic elements for better accessibility and SEO. For example, I used `<form>` elements for grouping input fields and `<label>` tags to improve usability. Once the structure was in place, I turned my attention to styling. I employed CSS for visual enhancements, adjusting properties like font size, colors, margins, and paddings to create a user-friendly interface. By the end of the day, I had a functional and visually appealing login page, and I felt a sense of accomplishment in seeing my code come to life. This experience also underscored the importance of front-end design in creating intuitive user experiences.
