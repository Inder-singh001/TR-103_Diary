### Continuation of Static HTML Login Page Using Vanilla CSS
Building on the previous day's work, I continued refining the login page. I realized the importance of user experience, so I focused on improving the aesthetics and functionality of the form. I incorporated additional CSS styles, such as hover effects for buttons and focus outlines for input fields, to enhance interactivity. This attention to detail made the page more engaging and responsive to user actions.

Additionally, I conducted tests to ensure the form functioned as intended. I learned how small details, like proper alignment and consistent spacing, can significantly impact the overall look of the webpage. By using developer tools, I analyzed the page's structure and styles, making real-time adjustments. This hands-on approach provided me with insights into troubleshooting common design issues. By the end of Day 3, I had not only polished the login page but also gained valuable insights into CSS practices and responsive design principles, which I knew would be essential for future projects.
