### Building Pages and Components in Next.js
On Day 16, I focused on building pages and components within the Next.js framework. I learned how to create dynamic pages that could pull data from external sources using Next.js's built-in data fetching methods. This knowledge was essential for developing applications that require real-time data updates.

I also explored the concept of components and how to structure my application for better maintainability. By breaking down the user interface into reusable components, I could enhance code organization and reduce redundancy. I built a simple homepage for my community forum project, implementing components for the header, footer, and main content area. This hands-on experience solidified my understanding of Next.js's architecture, and I began to appreciate its potential for scaling applications effectively.
