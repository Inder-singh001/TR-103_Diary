### Diving Deeper into JavaScript
On Day 12, I continued my exploration of JavaScript, diving deeper into more complex topics like arrays, objects, and event handling. I learned how to create and manipulate arrays, which are crucial for storing collections of data. Understanding objects was equally important, as they allow for the organization of related data and functions into a single structure.

I practiced writing event listeners to respond to user actions, such as clicks and key presses. This ability to create interactive elements on web pages made the development process more exciting. I built simple applications, such as a calculator, which reinforced my understanding of functions and user input. By the end of Day 12, I felt increasingly confident in my JavaScript skills and was eager to apply them in more complex scenarios.
