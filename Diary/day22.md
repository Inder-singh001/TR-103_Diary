### Continuing UI Responsiveness
Continuing from Day 21, I further enhanced the responsive design, paying special attention to mobile usability. I optimized button sizes, text readability, and overall navigation for smaller screens. This involved adjusting font sizes and ensuring that interactive elements were easily tappable.

Collaboration with peers provided valuable insights, and I iterated on the design based on feedback. This collaborative effort emphasized the importance of teamwork in web development. By the end of the day, I had made significant strides in creating a user-friendly, responsive interface that would appeal to a broad audience.
