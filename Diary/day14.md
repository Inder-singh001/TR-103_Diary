### Consolidating JavaScript Knowledge
On Day 14, I consolidated my JavaScript knowledge by working on a mini-project that required the integration of everything I had learned so far. I created a simple to-do list application that allowed users to add, edit, and delete tasks. This project brought together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to see how these technologies work in harmony.

I encountered challenges while managing state and ensuring that the application was responsive, but these obstacles provided valuable learning experiences. I implemented features like local storage to save tasks even after refreshing the page, reinforcing the importance of user experience. By the end of the day, I had a functioning to-do list application, which gave me a sense of accomplishment and a deeper understanding of how to build interactive web applications.
