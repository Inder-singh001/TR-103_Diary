### Designing the UI of the Project
On Day 19, I shifted my focus to designing the user interface of my community forum project. I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize the layout and user flow. Using design tools like Figma, I crafted a user-friendly interface that prioritized usability and aesthetics. I understood that a well-designed UI is crucial for attracting and retaining users.

I conducted user research to gather insights into user preferences and expectations. This information guided my design decisions, ensuring that the interface resonated with the target audience. Collaborating with peers allowed for constructive feedback, which I incorporated into my designs. This iterative process reinforced the idea that design is a continuous journey of improvement.
