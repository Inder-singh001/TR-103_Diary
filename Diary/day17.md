### Introduction to Next.js API Routes
On Day 17, I delved into Next.js API routes, which allow for server-side functionality within the framework. I learned how to create API endpoints and handle HTTP requests. This was an exciting aspect of Next.js, as it enabled me to build full-stack applications without needing a separate backend server.

I set up a simple API route that returned sample data, reinforcing the concept of client-server communication. This knowledge was vital for building applications that require data fetching and manipulation. I also explored middleware functions in Next.js, which allowed me to implement authentication and authorization for my API routes. This experience deepened my understanding of how to create robust applications that prioritize security and performance.
