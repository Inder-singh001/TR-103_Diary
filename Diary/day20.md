### Finalizing the UI Design
On Day 20, I finalized the UI design for the project, ensuring that all elements were cohesive and aligned with the forum's purpose. I conducted user testing on the prototypes, gathering feedback on the layout and functionality. This user-centric approach helped identify areas that needed refinement.

Incorporating feedback helped me make informed design decisions. For example, I adjusted button placements and simplified navigation based on user preferences. By the end of the day, I had a polished UI ready for implementation, and I felt confident in the direction of the project. This process highlighted the importance of collaboration and user feedback in the design phase, which would ultimately contribute to the project's success.
