### Creating a Database for the Project
On Day 24, I focused on setting up a database for the community forum project. I chose MongoDB for its flexibility and ease of use with JavaScript applications. I designed the database schema to store user information, posts, and comments, ensuring that data could be managed efficiently.

Using Mongoose, I established models for each entity in the forum. This step was crucial for managing data effectively and ensuring smooth communication between the server and database. I also implemented basic validation rules to maintain data integrity. By the end of the day, I had a functional database setup, which would support the core functionalities of the forum.
