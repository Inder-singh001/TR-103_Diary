### Making the UI Responsive
On Day 21, I focused on making the UI responsive, ensuring that it would adapt seamlessly to various devices. I implemented CSS media queries and flexbox to create a fluid layout. Understanding the principles of responsive design was crucial, as more users access the web on mobile devices than ever before.

I tested the responsiveness on different screen sizes, identifying areas that needed adjustment. I refined the design based on these tests, ensuring a positive user experience across devices. This process reinforced the importance of accessibility and usability in web design. By the end of Day 21, I had a fully responsive UI that provided a consistent experience across devices, boosting my confidence in the design.
